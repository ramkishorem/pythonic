Web Scraping

Goal is to get the premier league table dynamically at 127.0.0.1/prem-table

Let us assume there is no widget for this purpose. We have to scrap through another website's table and reproduce it on ours.

Hint: BeautifulSoup

table example:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Team</th>
        <th>Played</th>
        <th>Won</th>
        ...
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Manchester city</td>
        <td>38</td>
        <td>32</td>
        ...
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Manchester United</td>
        <td>38</td>
        ...
    </tr>
</table>


Level 2:
Bonus points to display green/red/grey barsets for win/loss/draw in the last six games
