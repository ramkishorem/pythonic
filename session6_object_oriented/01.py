Object-oriented programming (put on the grown-up pants)

Object-oriented programming is one of the most effective 
approaches to writing software.

You write 'classes' that are like software prototypes of 
real-world things with their situations and behaviours.

You can then create software 'objects' using the 
prototypes(classes). You can further customise the objects
after creating them with further behaviours.

Making an object from a class is called 'instantiation', 
and you work with 'instances' of a class.

Understanding object-oriented programming will help you see 
the world as a programmer does. It’ll help you really know 
your code, not just what’s happening line by line, but also 
the bigger concepts behind it.

Knowing the logic behind classes will train you to think logically 
so you can write programs that effectively address almost any 
problem you encounter.

Classes makes collaboration easy. Other people can quickly 
understand what you're doing without looking at individual lines 
of code.

Continue on for a more practical explanation with a simple class 
definition.
