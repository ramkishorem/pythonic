Drill 2: Pet medical history

Let us assume that the animal from the last drill is your pet.

(Store date with string in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format)

a) We want to update and view the last time you took your pet 
to the doctor. Update it through a method 'take_to_doctor'.

b) When we view the last time, we also want to look at the 
time before.

c) Instantiate the class, update three doctor visits and view 
the visits.

d) Can you keep track of each and every visit?
