Drill 1: Improved ordertaking

We did a limited version of order taking in an earlier session.
With the new tools in our arsenal, we can do a much more robust one.

1. Ask if the guest is ready to order.
2. If they are, ask if they want to order starter, main course,
    or desert.
3. After they pick a choice, ask for the name of the item, count
4. Once you get the item name, ask if they want to order more.
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3, until they are done.
6. When done, repeat the order (Starters first, then main course,
    then deserts).
